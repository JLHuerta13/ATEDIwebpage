            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout had himself disassembled 
            for the return journey. He had already been torn in half, he felt: 
            the remainder, the dumb beast still alive, did not matter. The 
            captain had ruled, and Katrin would not be brought back. Davout did 
            not want to spend the years between the stars in pain, confronting 
            the gaping absence in his quarters, surrounded by the quiet sympathy 
            of the crew.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Besides, he was no longer 
            needed. The terraforming team had done its work, and then, but for 
            Davout, had died.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout lay down on a bed of 
            nano and let the little machines take him apart piece by piece, turn 
            his body, his mind, and his unquenchable longing into long strings 
            of numbers. The nanomachines crawled into his brain first, mapping, 
            recording, and then shut down his mind piece by piece, so that he 
            would feel no discomfort during what followed, or suffer a memory of 
            his own body being taken apart.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout hoped that the nanos 
            would shut down the pain before his consciousness failed, so that he 
            could remember what it was like to live without the anguish that was 
            now a part of his life, but it didn&#8217;t work out that way. When his 
            consciousness ebbed, he was aware, even to the last fading of the 
            light, of the knife-blade of loss still buried in his 
            heart.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>The pain was there when Davout 
            awoke, a wailing voice that cried, a pure contralto keen of agony, 
            in his first dawning awareness. He found himself in an 
            early-Victorian bedroom, blue-striped wallpaper, silhouettes in oval 
            frames, silk flowers in vases. Crisp sheets, light streaming in the 
            window. A stranger&#8211;shoulder-length hair, black frock coat, cravat 
            carelessly tied&#8211;looked at him from a gothic-revival armchair. The 
            man held a pipe in the right hand and tamped down tobacco with the 
            prehensile big toe of his left foot.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I&#8217;m not on the <I>Beagle,</I>" 
            Davout said.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>The man gave a grave nod. His 
            left hand formed the mudra for &lt;correct&gt;. "Yes."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"And this isn&#8217;t a 
            virtual?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Correct&gt; again. 
            "No."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Then something has gone 
            wrong."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Correct&gt; "Yes. A moment, 
            sir, if you please." The man finished tamping, slipped his foot into 
            a waiting boot, then lit the pipe with the anachronistic lighter in 
            his left hand. He puffed, drew in smoke, exhaled, put the lighter in 
            his pocket, and settled back in the walnut embrace of his 
            chair.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I am Dr. Li," he said. 
            &lt;Stand by&gt; said the left hand, the old finger position for a 
            now-obsolete palmtop computer, a finger position that had once meant 
            <I>pause,</I> as &lt;correct&gt; had once meant <I>enter,</I> enter 
            because it was correct. "Please remain in bed for a few more minutes 
            while the nanos doublecheck their work. Redundancy is frustrating," 
            puffing smoke, "but good for peace of mind."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"What happens if they find 
            they&#8217;ve made a mistake?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Don&#8217;t be concerned.&gt; "It 
            can&#8217;t be a very large mistake," said Li, "or we wouldn&#8217;t be 
            communicating so rationally. At worst, you will sleep for a bit 
            while things are corrected."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"May I take my hands out from 
            under the covers?" he asked.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Yes."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout did so. His hands, he 
            observed, were brown and leathery, hands suitable for the hot, dry 
            world of Sarpedon. They had not, then, changed his body for one more 
            suited to Earth, but given him something familiar. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>If, he realized, they were on 
            Earth.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>His right fingers made the 
            mudra &lt;thank you&gt;.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Don&#8217;t mention it&gt; signed 
            Li.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout passed a hand over his 
            forehead, discovered that the forehead, hand, and the gesture itself 
            were perfectly familiar.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Strange, but the gesture 
            convinced him that he was, in a vital way, still himself. Still 
            Davout.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Still alive, he thought. 
            Alas.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Tell me what happened," he 
            said. "Tell me why I&#8217;m here."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Li signed &lt;stand by&gt;, 
            made a visible effort to collect himself. "We believe," he said, 
            "that the <I>Beagle</I> was destroyed. If so, you are the only 
            survivor."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout found his shock 
            curiously veiled. The loss of the other lives&#8211;friends, most of 
            them&#8211;stood muted by the precedent of his own earlier, overriding 
            grief. It was as if the two losses were weighed in a balance, and 
            the <I>Beagle</I> found wanting.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Li, Davout observed, was 
            waiting for Davout to absorb this information before 
            continuing.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Go on&gt; Davout 
            signed.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"The accident happened seven 
            light-years out," Li said. "<I>Beagle</I> began to yaw wildly, and 
            both automatic systems and the crew failed to correct the maneuver. 
            <I>Beagle</I>&#8217;s automatic systems concluded that the ship was 
            unlikely to survive the increasing oscillations, and began to use 
            its communications lasers to download personality data to collectors 
            in Earth orbit. As the only crew member to elect disassembly during 
            the return journey, you were first in the queue. The others, we 
            presume, ran to nano disassembly stations, but communication was 
            lost with the <I>Beagle</I> before we retrieved any of their 
            data."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Did Katrin&#8217;s come 
            through?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Li stirred uneasily in his 
            chair. &lt;Regrettably&gt; "I&#8217;m afraid not."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout closed his eyes. He had 
            lost her again. Over the bubble of hopelessness in his throat he 
            asked, "How long has it been since my data arrived?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"A little over eight 
            days."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>They had waited eight days, 
            then, for <I>Beagle</I>&#8211;for the <I>Beagle</I> of seven years ago&#8211;to 
            correct its problem and reestablish communication. If <I>Beagle</I> 
            had resumed contact, the mass of data that was Davout might have 
            been erased as redundant.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"The government has announced 
            the loss," Li said. "Though there is a remote chance that the 
            <I>Beagle</I> may come flying in or through the system in eleven 
            years as scheduled, we have detected no more transmissions, and 
            we&#8217;ve been unable to observe any blueshifted deceleration torch 
            aimed at our system. The government decided that it would be unfair 
            to keep sibs and survivors in the dark any longer."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Concur&gt; Davout 
            signed.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He envisioned the last moments 
            of the <I>Beagle,</I> the crew being flung back and forth as the 
            ship slammed through increasing pendulum swings, the desperate 
            attempts, fighting wildly fluctuating gravity and inertia, to reach 
            the emergency nanobeds . . . no panic, Davout thought, Captain 
            Moshweshwe had trained his people too well for that. Just 
            desperation, and determination, and, as the oscillations grew worse, 
            an increasing sense of futility, and impending death.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>No one expected to die anymore. 
            It was always a shock when it happened near you. Or <I>to</I> 
            you.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"The cause of the 
            <I>Beagle</I>&#8217;s problem remains unknown," Li said, the voice far 
            away. "The Bureau is working with simulators to try to discover what 
            happened."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout leaned back against his 
            pillow. Pain throbbed in his veins, pain and loss, knowledge that 
            his past, his joy, was irrecoverable. "The whole voyage," he said, 
            "was a catastrophe."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;I respectfully 
            contradict&gt; Li signed. "You terraformed and explored two worlds," 
            he said. "Downloads are already living on these worlds, hundreds of 
            thousands now, millions later. There would have been a third world 
            added to our commonwealth if your mission had not been cut short due 
            to the, ah, first accident . . ."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Concur&gt; Davout signed, 
            but only because his words would have come out with too much 
            bitterness.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Sorry&gt;, a curt jerk of 
            Li&#8217;s fingers. "There are messages from your sibs," Li said, "and 
            downloads from them also. The sibs and friends of <I>Beagle</I>&#8217;s 
            crew will try to contact you, no doubt. You need not answer any of 
            these messages until you&#8217;re ready."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Understood.&gt;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout hesitated, but the words 
            were insistent; he gave them tongue. "Have Katrin&#8217;s sibs sent 
            messages?" he asked.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Li&#8217;s grave expression scarcely 
            changed. "I believe so." He tilted his head. "Is there anything I 
            can do for you? Anything I can arrange?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Not now, no," said Davout. 
            &lt;Thank you&gt; he signed. "Can I move from the bed 
            now?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Li&#8217;s look turned abstract as he 
            scanned indicators projected somewhere in his mind. &lt;Yes&gt; "You 
            may," he said. He rose from his chair, took the pipe from his mouth. 
            "You are in a hospital, I should add," he said, "but you do not have 
            the formal status of patient, and may leave at any time. Likewise, 
            you may stay here for the foreseeable future, as long as you feel it 
            necessary."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Thank you&gt; "Where is 
            this hospital, by the way?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"West Java. The city of 
            Bandung."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Earth, then. Which Davout had 
            not seen in seventy-seven years. Memory&#8217;s gentle fingers touched his 
            mind with the scent of durian, of ocean, of mace, cloves, and 
            turmeric.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He knew he had never been in 
            Java before, though, and wondered whence the memory came. From one 
            of his sibs, perhaps?</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Thank you&gt; Davout signed 
            again, putting a touch of finality, a kind of dismissal, into the 
            twist of his fingers.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Dr. Li left Davout alone, in 
            his new/old body, in the room that whispered of memory and 
            pain.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>In a dark wood armoire, Davout 
            found identification and clothing, and a record confirming that his 
            account had received seventy-eight years&#8217; back pay. His electronic 
            inbox contained downloads from his sibs and more personal messages 
            than he could cope with&#8211;he would have to construct an electronic 
            personality to answer most of them. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He dressed and left the 
            hospital. Whoever supervised his reassembly&#8211;Dr. Li perhaps&#8211;had 
            thoughtfully included a complete Earth atlas in his internal ROM, 
            and he accessed it as he walked, making random turnings but never 
            getting lost. The furious sun burned down with tropical intensity, 
            but his current body was constructed to bear heat, and a breeze off 
            the mountains made pleasant even the blazing noontide.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>The joyful metal music of the 
            <I>gamelans</I> clattered from almost every doorway. People in 
            bright clothing, agile as the siamang of near Sumatra, sped overhead 
            along treeways and ropeways, arms and hands modified for 
            brachiation. Robots, immune to the heat, shimmered past on silent 
            tires. Davout found it all strangely familiar, as if he had been 
            here in a dream.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>And then he found himself by 
            the sea, and a pang of familiarity knifed through his heart. 
            <I>Home!</I> cried his thoughts. Other worlds he had built, other 
            beauties he had seen, but he had never beheld <I>this</I> blue, 
            <I>this</I> perfection, anywhere else but on his native sphere. 
            Subtle differences in atmospherics had rendered this color unnatural 
            on any other world.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>And with the cry of familiarity 
            came a memory: it had been Davout the Silent who had come here, a 
            century or more ago, and Katrin had been by his side.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>But Davout&#8217;s Katrin was dead. 
            And as he looked on Earth&#8217;s beauty, he felt his world of joy turn to 
            bitter ashes.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Alas!&gt; His fingers 
            formed the word unbidden. &lt;Alas!&gt;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He lived in a world where no 
            one died, and nothing was ever lost. One understood that such things 
            occasionally occurred, but never&#8211;hardly ever&#8211;to anyone that one 
            knew. Physical immortality was cheap and easy, and was supported by 
            so many alternate systems: backing up the mind by downloading, or 
            downloading into a virtual reality system or into a durable machine. 
            Nanosystems duplicated the body or improved it, adapted it for 
            different environments. Data slumbered in secure storage, awaiting 
            the electron kiss that returned it to life. Bringing a child to term 
            in the womb was now the rarest form of reproduction, and bringing a 
            child to life in a machine womb the next rarest.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>It was so much easier to have 
            the nanos duplicate you as an adult. Then, at least, you had someone 
            to talk to.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>No one died, and nothing was 
            ever lost. But Katrin died, Davout thought, and now I am lost, and 
            it was not supposed to be this way.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Alas!&gt; Fingers wailed 
            the grief that was stopped up in Davout&#8217;s throat. 
            &lt;Alas!&gt;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout and Katrin had met in 
            school, members of the last generation in which womb-breeding 
            outnumbered the alternatives. Immortality whispered its covenant 
            into their receptive ears. On their first meeting, attending a 
            lecture (Dolphus on "Reinventing the Humboldt Sea") at the College 
            of Mystery, they looked at each other and <I>knew,</I> as if angels 
            had whispered into their ears, that there was now one less mystery 
            in the world, that each served as an answer to another, that each 
            fitted neatly into a hollow that the other had perceived in his or 
            her soul, dropping into place as neatly as a butter-smooth piece in 
            a finely made teak puzzle&#8211;or, considering their interests, as easily 
            as a carbolic functional group nested into place on an indole ring. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Their rapport was, they freely 
            admitted, miraculous. Still young, they exploded into the world, 
            into a universe that welcomed them. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He could not bear to be away 
            from her. Twenty-four hours was the absolute limit before Davout&#8217;s 
            nerves began to beat a frustrated little tattoo, and he found 
            himself conjuring a phantom Katrin in his imagination, just to have 
            someone to share the world with&#8211;he <I>needed</I> her there, needed 
            this human lens through which he viewed the universe.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Without her, Davout found the 
            cosmos veiled in a kind of uncertainty. While it was possible to 
            apprehend certain things (the usefulness of a coenocytic arrangement 
            of cells in the transmission of information-bearing proteins and 
            nuclei, the historical significance of the Yucatan astrobleme, the 
            limitations of the Benard cell model in predicting thermic 
            instabilities in the atmosphere), these things lacked <I>nóesis,</I> 
            existed only as a series of singular, purposeless accidents. 
            Reflected through Katrin, however, the world took on brilliance, 
            purpose, and genius. With Katrin he could feast upon the universe; 
            without her the world lacked savor.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Their interests were similar 
            enough for each to generate enthusiasm in the other, diverse enough 
            that each was able to add perspective to the other&#8217;s work. They 
            worked in cozy harmony, back to back, two desks set in the same 
            room. Sometimes Davout would return from a meeting, or a coffee 
            break, and find that Katrin had added new paragraphs, sometimes an 
            entire new direction, to his latest effort. On occasion he would 
            return the favor. Their early work&#8211;eccentric, proliferating in too 
            many directions, toward too many specialties&#8211;showed life and promise 
            and more than a hint of brilliance.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Too much, they decided, for 
            just the two of them. They wanted to do too much, and all at once, 
            and an immortal lifetime was not time enough.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>And so, as soon as they could 
            afford it, Red Katrin, the original, was duplicated&#8211;with a few 
            cosmetic alterations&#8211;in Dark Katrin and later Katrin the Fair; and 
            nanomachines read Old Davout, blood and bone and the long strands of 
            numbers that were his soul, and created perfect copies in Dangerous 
            Davout, later called the Conqueror, and Davout the 
Silent.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Two had become six, and half a 
            dozen, they now agreed, was about all the universe could handle for 
            the present. The wild tangle of overlapping interests was parceled 
            out between the three couples, each taking one of the three most 
            noble paths to understanding. The eldest couple chose History as 
            their domain, a part of which involved chronicling the adventures of 
            their sibs; the second couple took Science; the third Psyche, the 
            exploration of the human mind. Any developments, any insights, on 
            the part of one of the sibs could be shared with the others through 
            downloads. In the beginning they downloaded themselves almost 
            continually, sharing their thoughts and experiences and plans in a 
            creative frenzy. Later, as separate lives and more specialized 
            careers developed, the downloads grew less frequent, though there 
            were no interruptions until Dangerous Davout and Dark Katrin took 
            their first voyage to another star. They spent over fifty years 
            away, though to them it was less than thirty; and the downloads from 
            Earth, pulsed over immense distances by communications lasers, were 
            less frequent, and less frequently resorted to. The lives of the 
            other couples, lived at what seemed speeded-up rates, were of 
            decreasing relevance to their own existence, as if they were lives 
            that dwelled in a half-remembered dream.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Alas!&gt; the fingers 
            signed. &lt;Alas!&gt; for the dream turned to savage 
            nightmare.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>The sea, a perfect terrestrial 
            blue, gazed back into Davout&#8217;s eyes, indifferent to the sadness 
            frozen into his fingers. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Your doctors knew that to wake 
            here, after such an absence, would result in a feeling of 
            anachronism," said Davout&#8217;s sib, "so they put you in this Victorian 
            room, where you would at least feel at ease with the kind of 
            anachronism by which you are surrounded." He smiled at Davout from 
            the neo-gothic armchair. "If you were in a modern room, you might 
            experience a sensation of obsolescence. But everyone can feel 
            superior to the Victorians, and besides, one is always more 
            comfortable in one&#8217;s past."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Is one?" Davout asked, fingers 
            signing &lt;irony&gt;. The past and the present, he found, were 
            alike a place of torment. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I discover," he continued, 
            "that my thoughts stray for comfort not to the past, but to the 
            future."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Ah." A smile. "That is why we 
            call you Davout the Conqueror."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I do not seem to inhabit that 
            name," Davout said, "if I ever did."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Concern shadowed the face of 
            Davout&#8217;s sib. &lt;Sorry&gt; he signed, and then made another sign 
            for &lt;profoundly&gt;, the old <I>multiply</I> sign, multiples of 
            sorrow in his gesture.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I understand," he said. "I 
            experienced your last download. It was . . . intensely disturbing. I 
            have never felt such terror, such loss."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Nor had I," said 
            Davout.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>It was Old Davout whose image 
            was projected into the gothic-revival armchair, the original, 
            womb-born Davout of whom the two sibs were copies. When Davout 
            looked at him it was like looking into a mirror in which his 
            reflection had been retarded for several centuries, then 
            unexpectedly released&#8211;Davout remembered, several bodies back, once 
            possessing that tall forehead, the fair hair, the small ears 
            flattened close to the skull. The grey eyes he had still, but he 
            could never picture himself wearing the professorial little goatee. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"How is our other sib?" Davout 
            asked.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>The concern on Old Davout&#8217;s 
            face deepened. "You will find Silent Davout much changed. You 
            haven&#8217;t uploaded him, then?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;No&gt; "Due to the delays, 
            I&#8217;m thirty years behind on my uploading."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Ah." &lt;Regret&gt; "Perhaps 
            you should speak to him, then, before you upload all those 
            years."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I will." He looked at his sib 
            and hoped the longing did not burn in his eyes. "Please give my best 
            to Katrin, will you?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I will give her your 
            <I>love,</I>" said Old Davout, wisest of the sibs.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>The pain was there when Davout 
            awoke next day, fresh as the moment it first knifed through him, on 
            the day their fifth child, the planet Sarpedon, was christened. 
            Sarpedon had been discovered by astronomers a couple of centuries 
            before, and named, with due regard for tradition, after yet another 
            minor character in Homer; it had been mapped and analyzed by robot 
            probes; but it had been the <I>Beagle</I>&#8217;s terraforming team that 
            had made the windswept place, with its barren mountain ranges and 
            endless deserts, its angry radiation and furious dust storms, into a 
            place suitable for life.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Katrin was the head of the 
            terraforming team. Davout led its research division. Between them, 
            raining nano from Sarpedon&#8217;s black skies, they nursed the planet to 
            life, enriched its atmosphere, filled its seas, crafted tough, 
            versatile vegetation capable of withstanding the angry environment. 
            Seeded life by the tens of millions, insects, reptiles, birds, 
            mammals, fish, and amphibians. Re-created themselves, with dark, 
            leathery skin and slit pupils, as human forms suitable for 
            Sarpedon&#8217;s environment, so that they could examine the place they 
            had built.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>And&#8211;unknown to the 
            others&#8211;Davout and Katrin had slipped bits of their own genetics into 
            almost every Sarpedan life-form. Bits of redundant coding, mostly, 
            but enough so that they could claim Sarpedon&#8217;s entire world of 
            creatures as their children. Even when they were junior terraformers 
            on the <I>Cheng Ho</I>&#8217;s mission to Rhea, they had, partly as a 
            joke, partly as something more calculated, populated their creations 
            with their genes.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Katrin and Davout spent the 
            last two years of their project on Sarpedon among their children, 
            examining the different ecosystems, different interactions, 
            tinkering with new adaptations. In the end, Sarpedon was certified 
            as suitable for human habitation. Preprogrammed nanos constructed 
            small towns, laid out fields, parks, and roads. The first human 
            Sarpedans would be constructed in nanobeds, and their minds filled 
            with the downloaded personalities of volunteers from Earth. There 
            was no need to go to the expense and trouble of shipping out 
            millions of warm bodies from Earth, running the risks of traveling 
            for decades in remote space. Not when nanos could construct them all 
            new on site.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>The first Sarpedans&#8211;bald, 
            leather-skinned, slit-eyed&#8211;emerged blinking into their new red dawn. 
            Any further terraforming, any attempts to fine-tune the planet and 
            make it more Earthlike, would be a long-term project and up to them. 
            In a splendid ceremony, Captain Moshweshwe formally turned the 
            future of Sarpedon over to its new inhabitants. Davout had a few 
            last formalities to perform, handing certain computer codes and 
            protocols over to the Sarpedans, but the rest of the terraforming 
            team, most fairly drunk on champagne, filed into the shuttle for the 
            return journey to the <I>Beagle</I>. As Davout bent over a terminal 
            with his Sarpedan colleagues and the <I>Beagle</I>&#8217;s first officer, 
            he could hear the roar of the shuttle on its pad, the sustained 
            thunder as it climbed for orbit, the thud as it crashed through the 
            sound barrier, and then he saw out of the corner of his eye the 
            sudden red-gold flare . . .</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>When he raced outside, it was 
            to see the blazing poppy unfolding in the sky, a blossom of fire and 
            metal falling slowly to the surface of the newly christened planet. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>There she was&#8211;her image 
            anyway&#8211;in the neo-gothic armchair: Red Katrin, the green-eyed lady 
            with whom he in memory, and Old Davout in reality, had first 
            exchanged glances two centuries ago while Dolphus expanded on what 
            he called his "lunaforming."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout had hesitated about 
            returning her call of condolence. He did not know whether his heart 
            could sustain <I>two</I> knife-thrusts, both Katrin&#8217;s death and the 
            sight of her sib, alive, sympathetic, and forever beyond his reach. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>But he couldn&#8217;t <I>not</I> call 
            her. Even when he was trying not to think about her, he still found 
            Katrin on the edge of his perceptions, drifting though his thoughts 
            like the persistent trace of some familiar perfume. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Time to get it over with, he 
            thought. If it was more than he could stand, he could apologize and 
            end the call. But he had to <I>know</I> . . .</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"And there are no backups?" she 
            said. A pensive frown touched her lips.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"No <I>recent</I> backups," 
            Davout said. "We always thought that, if we were to die, we would 
            die together. Space travel is hazardous, after all, and when 
            catastrophe strikes it is not a <I>small</I> catastrophe. We didn&#8217;t 
            anticipate one of us surviving on Earth, and the other dying 
            light-years away." He scowled.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Damn Mosheshwe anyway! There 
            were recent backups on the <I>Beagle,</I> but with so many dead from 
            an undetermined cause, he decided not to resurrect anyone, to cancel 
            our trip to Astoreth, return to Earth, and sort out all the 
            complications once he got home."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"He made the right decision," 
            Katrin said. "If my sib had been resurrected, you both would have 
            died together."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Better so&gt; Davout&#8217;s 
            fingers began to form the mudra, but he thought better of it, made a 
            gesture of negation.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>The green eyes narrowed. "There 
            are older backups on Earth, yes?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Katrin&#8217;s latest surviving 
            backup dates from the return of the <I>Cheng Ho</I>."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Almost ninety years ago." 
            Thoughtfully. "But she could upload the memories she has been 
            sending me . . . the problem does not seem insurmountable." 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Red Katrin clasped her hands 
            around one knee. At the familiar gesture, memories rang through 
            Davout&#8217;s mind like change-bells. Vertigo overwhelmed him, and he 
            closed his eyes.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"The problem is the 
            instructions Katrin&#8211;we both&#8211;left," he said. "Again, we anticipated 
            that if we died, we&#8217;d die together. And so we left instructions that 
            our backups on Earth were not to be employed. We reasoned that we 
            had two sibs apiece on Earth, and if they&#8211;you&#8211;missed us, you could 
            simply duplicate yourselves."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I see." A pause, then concern. 
            "Are you all right?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;No&gt; "Of course not," he 
            said. He opened his eyes. The world eddied for a moment, then 
            stilled, the growing calmness centered on Red Katrin&#8217;s green eyes. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I&#8217;ve got seventy-odd years&#8217; 
            back pay," he said. "I suppose that I could hire some lawyers, try 
            to get Katrin&#8217;s backup released to my custody."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Red Katrin bit her nether lip. 
            "Recent court decisions are not in your favor."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I&#8217;m very persistent. And I&#8217;m 
            cash-rich."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She cocked her head, looked at 
            him. "Are you all right talking to me? Should I blank my 
            image?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;No.&gt; He shook his head. 
            "It helps, actually, to see you."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He had feared agony in seeing 
            her, but instead he found a growing joy, a happiness that mounted in 
            his heart. As always, his Katrin was helping him to understand, 
            helping him to make sense of the bitter confusion of the 
            world.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>An idea began to creep into his 
            mind on stealthy feet.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I worry that you&#8217;re alone 
            there," Red Katrin said. "Would you like to come stay with us? Would 
            you like us to come to Java?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;No, thanks&gt; "I&#8217;ll come 
            see you soon," Davout said. "But while I&#8217;m in the hospital, I think 
            I&#8217;ll have a few cosmetic procedures." He looked down at himself, 
            spread his leathery hands. "Perhaps I should look a little more 
            Earthlike."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>After his talk with Katrin 
            ended, Davout called Dr. Li and told him that he wanted a new body 
            constructed.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Something familiar, he said, 
            already in the files. His own, original form.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Age twenty or so.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"It is a surprise to see you . 
            . . as you are," said Silent Davout.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Deep-voiced, black-skinned, and 
            somber, Davout&#8217;s sib stood by his bed.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"It was a useful body when I 
            wore it," Davout answered. "I take comfort in . . . familiar things 
            . . . now that my life is so uncertain." He looked up. "It was good 
            of you to come in person."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"A holographic body," he said, 
            taking Davout&#8217;s hand, "however welcome, however familiar, is not the 
            same as a real person."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout squeezed the hand. 
            "Welcome, then," he said. Dr. Li, who had supervised in person 
            through the new/old body&#8217;s assembly, had left after saying the nanos 
            were done, so it seemed appropriate for Davout to stand and embrace 
            his sib. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>The youngest of the sibs was 
            not tall, but he was built solidly, as if for permanence, and his 
            head seemed slightly oversized for his body. With his older sibs, he 
            had always maintained a kind of formal reserve that had resulted in 
            his being nicknamed "the Silent." Accepting the name, he remarked 
            that the reason he spoke little when the others were around was that 
            his older sibs had already said everything that needed saying before 
            he got to it.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout stepped back and smiled. 
            "Your patients must think you a tower of strength."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I have no patients these days. 
            Mostly I work in the realm of theory."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I will have to look up your 
            work. I&#8217;m so far behind on uploads&#8211;I don&#8217;t have any idea what you 
            and Katrin have been doing these last decades."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Silent Davout stepped to the 
            armoire and opened its ponderous mahogany doors. "Perhaps you should 
            put on some clothing," he said. "I am feeling chill in this 
            conditioned air, and so must you."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Amused, Davout clothed himself, 
            then sat across the little rosewood side table from his sib. Davout 
            the Silent looked at him for a long moment&#8211;eyes placid and 
            thoughtful&#8211;and then spoke.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"You are experiencing something 
            that is very rare in our time," he said. "Loss, anger, frustration, 
            terror. All the emotions that in their totality equal 
            <I>grief</I>."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"You forgot sadness and 
            regret," Davout said. "You forgot memory, and how the memories keep 
            replaying. You forgot <I>imagination,</I> and how imagination only 
            makes those memories worse, because imagination allows you to write 
            a different ending, but the world will not."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Silent Davout nodded. "People 
            in my profession," fingers forming &lt;irony&gt;, "anyway those born 
            too late to remember how common these things once were, must view 
            you with a certain clinical interest. I must commend Dr. Li on his 
            restraint."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Dr. Li is a shrink?" Davout 
            asked.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Yes.&gt; A casual press of 
            fingers. "Among other things. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s watching you very 
            carefully and making little notes every time he leaves the 
            room."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I&#8217;m happy to be useful." 
            &lt;Irony&gt; in his hand, bitterness on his tongue. "I would give 
            those people my memories, if they want them so much."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Of course&gt; "You can do 
            that." </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout looked up in something 
            like surprise. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"You know it is possible," his 
            sib said. "You can download your memories, preserve them like amber 
            or simply hand them to someone else to experience. And you can erase 
            them from your mind completely, walk on into a new life, <I>tabula 
            rasa</I> and free of pain."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>His deep voice was soft. It was 
            a voice without affect, one he no doubt used on his patients, 
            quietly insistent without being officious. A voice that made 
            suggestions, or presented alternatives, but which never, ever, gave 
            orders.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I don&#8217;t want that," Davout 
            said.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Silent Davout&#8217;s fingers were 
            still set in &lt;of course&gt;. "You are not of the generation that 
            accepts such things as a matter of course," he said. "But this, this 
            <I>modular</I> approach to memory, to being, constitutes much of my 
            work these days."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout looked at him. "It must 
            be like losing a piece of yourself, to give up a memory. Memories 
            are what make you."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Silent Davout&#8217;s face remained 
            impassive as his deep voice sounded through the void between them. 
            "What forms a human psyche is not a memory, we have come to believe, 
            but a pattern of thought. When our sib duplicated himself, he 
            duplicated his pattern in us; and when we assembled new bodies to 
            live in, the pattern did not change. Have you felt yourself to be a 
            different person when you took a new body?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout passed a hand over his 
            head, felt the fine blond hair covering his scalp. This time 
            yesterday, his head had been bald and leathery. Now he felt subtle 
            differences in his perceptions&#8211;his vision was more acute, his 
            hearing less so&#8211;and his muscle memory was somewhat askew. He 
            remembered having a shorter reach, a slightly different center of 
            gravity. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>But as for <I>himself,</I> his 
            essence&#8211;no, he felt himself unchanged. He was still Davout. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;No&gt; he 
signed.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"People have more choices than 
            ever before," said Silent Davout. "They choose their bodies, they 
            choose their memories. They can upload new knowledge, new skills. If 
            they feel a lack of confidence, or feel that their behavior is too 
            impulsive, they can tweak their body chemistry to produce a 
            different effect. If they find themselves the victim of an 
            unfortunate or destructive compulsion, the compulsion can be edited 
            from their being. If they lack the power to change their 
            circumstances, they can at least elect to feel happier about them. 
            If a memory cannot be overcome, it can be eliminated."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"And you now spend your time 
            dealing with these problems?" Davout asked.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"They are not <I>problems,</I>" 
            his sib said gently. "They are not <I>syndromes</I> or 
            <I>neuroses.</I> They are <I>circumstances.</I> They are part of the 
            condition of life as it exists today. They are environmental." The 
            large, impassive eyes gazed steadily at Davout. "People choose 
            happiness over sorrow, fulfillment over frustration. Can you blame 
            them?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Yes&gt; Davout signed. "If 
            they deny the evidence of their own lives," he said. "We define our 
            existence by the challenges we overcome, or those we don&#8217;t. Even our 
            tragedies define us."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>His sib nodded. "That is an 
            admirable philosophy&#8211;for Davout the Conqueror. But not all people 
            are conquerors."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout strove to keep the 
            impatience from his voice. "Lessons are learned from failures as 
            well as successes. Experience is gained, life&#8217;s knowledge is applied 
            to subsequent occurrence. If we deny the uses of experience, what is 
            there to make us human?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>His sib was patient. "Sometimes 
            the experiences are negative, and so are the lessons. Would you have 
            a person live forever under the shadow of great guilt, say for a 
            foolish mistake that resulted in injury or death to someone else; or 
            would you have them live with the consequences of damage inflicted 
            by a sociopath, or an abusive family member? Traumas like these can 
            cripple the whole being. Why should the damage not be 
            repaired?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout smiled thinly. "You 
            can&#8217;t tell me that these techniques are used only in cases of deep 
            trauma," he said. "You can&#8217;t tell me that people aren&#8217;t using these 
            techniques for reasons that might be deemed trivial. Editing out a 
            foolish remark made at a party, or eliminating a bad vacation or an 
            argument with the spouse."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Silent Davout returned his 
            smile. "I would not insult your intelligence by suggesting these 
            things do not happen."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Q.E.D.&gt; Davout signed. 
            "So how do such people mature? Change? Grow in wisdom?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"They cannot edit out 
            <I>everything</I>. There is sufficient friction and conflict in the 
            course of ordinary life to provide everyone with their allotted 
            portion of wisdom. Nowadays our lives are very, very long, and we 
            have a long time to learn, however slowly. And after all," he said, 
            smiling, "the average person&#8217;s capacity for wisdom has never been so 
            large as all <I>that!</I> I think you will find that as a species we 
            are far less prone to folly than we once were."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout looked at his sib 
            grimly. "You are suggesting that I undergo this 
            technique?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"It is called 
Lethe."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"That I undergo Lethe? Forget 
            Katrin? Or forget what I feel for her?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Silent Davout slowly shook his 
            grave head. "I make no such suggestion."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Good."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>The youngest Davout gazed 
            steadily into the eyes of his older twin. "Only you know what you 
            can bear. I merely point out that this remedy exists, should you 
            find your anguish beyond what you can endure."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Katrin deserves mourning," 
            Davout said.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Another grave nod. 
            "Yes."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"She deserves to be remembered. 
            Who will remember her if I do not?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I understand," said Silent 
            Davout. "I understand your desire to feel, and the necessity. I only 
            mention Lethe because I comprehend all too well what you endure now. 
            Because"&#8211;he licked his lips&#8211;"I, too, have lost Katrin."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout gaped at him. "You&#8211;" he 
            stammered. "She is&#8211;she was killed?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;No.&gt; His sib&#8217;s face 
            retained its remarkable placidity. "She left me, sixteen years 
            ago."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout could only stare. The 
            fact, stated so plainly, was incomprehensible. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I&#8211;" he began, and then his 
            fingers found another thought. &lt;What happened?&gt;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"We were together for a century 
            and a half. We grew apart. It happens."</FONT></P>
            <P><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Not to us it 
            doesn&#8217;t!</FONT></I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2> Davout&#8217;s mind 
            protested. <I>Not to Davout and Katrin!</I></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Not to the two people who make 
            up a whole greater than its parts. Not to <I>us</I>. Not 
            ever.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>But looking into his sib&#8217;s 
            accepting, melancholy face, Davout knew that it had to be 
            true.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>And then, in a way he knew to 
            be utterly disloyal, he began to hope.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Shocking?" said Old Davout. 
            "Not to us, I suppose." </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"It was their downloads," said 
            Red Katrin. "Fair Katrin in particular was careful to edit out some 
            of her feelings and judgments before she let me upload them, but 
            still I could see her attitudes changing. And knowing her, I could 
            make guesses by what she left out . . . I remember telling Davout 
            three years before the split that the relationship was in 
            jeopardy."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"The Silent One was still 
            surprised, though, when it happened," Old Davout said. 
            "Sophisticated though he may be about human nature, he had a blind 
            spot where Katrin was concerned." He put an arm around Red Katrin 
            and kissed her cheek. "As I suppose we all do," he added.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Katrin accepted the kiss with a 
            gracious inclination of her head, then asked Davout, "Would you like 
            the blue room here, or the green room upstairs? The green room has a 
            window seat and a fine view of the bay, but it&#8217;s small."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I&#8217;ll take the green room," 
            Davout said. I do not need so much room, he thought, now that I am 
            alone.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Katrin took him up the creaking 
            wooden stair and showed him the room, the narrow bed of the old 
            house. Through the window, he could look south to a storm on 
            Chesapeake Bay, bluegray cloud, bright eruptions of lightning, 
            slanting beams of sunlight that dropped through rents in the storm 
            to tease bright winking light from the foam. He watched it for a 
            long moment, then was startled out of reverie by Katrin&#8217;s hand on 
            his shoulder, and a soft voice in his ear.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Are there sights like this on 
            other worlds?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"The storms on Rhea were vast," 
            Davout said, "like nothing on this world. The ocean area is greater 
            than that on Earth, and lies mostly in the tropics&#8211;the planet was 
            almost called Oceanus on that account. The hurricanes built up 
            around the equatorial belts with nothing to stop them, sometimes 
            more than a thousand kilometers across, and they came roaring into 
            the temperate zones like multi-armed demons, sometimes one after 
            another for months. They spawned waterspots and cyclones in their 
            vanguard, inundated whole areas with a storm surge the size of a 
            small ocean, dumped enough rain to flood an entire province away. . 
            . . We thought seriously that the storms might make life on land 
            untenable."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He went on to explain the 
            solution he and Katrin had devised for the enormous problem: huge 
            strings of tall, rocky barrier islands built at a furious rate by 
            nanomachines, a wall for wind and storm surge to break against; a 
            species of silvery, tropical floating weed, a flowery girdle about 
            Rhea&#8217;s thick waist, that radically increased surface albedo, 
            reflecting more heat back into space. Many species of deep-rooted, 
            vinelike plants to anchor slopes and prevent erosion, other species 
            of thirsty trees, adaptations of cottonwoods and willows, to line 
            streambeds and break the power of flash floods. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Planetary engineering on such 
            an enormous scale, in such a short time, had never been attempted, 
            not even on Mars, and it had been difficult for Katrin and Davout to 
            sell the project to the project managers on the <I>Cheng Ho.</I> 
            Their superiors had initially preferred a different approach, huge 
            equatorial solar curtains deployed in orbit to reflect heat, 
            squadrons of orbital beam weapons to blast and disperse storms as 
            they formed, secure underground dwellings for the inhabitants, 
            complex lock and canal systems to control flooding . . . Katrin and 
            Davout had argued for a more elegant approach to Rhea&#8217;s problems, a 
            reliance on organic systems to modify the planet&#8217;s extreme weather 
            instead of assaulting Rhea with macro-tech and engineering. Theirs 
            was the approach that finally won the support of the majority of the 
            terraforming team, and resulted in their subsequent appointment as 
            heads of <I>Beagle</I>&#8217;s terraforming team.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Dark Katrin&#8217;s memories were 
            very exciting to upload during that time," said Katrin the Red. 
            "That delirious explosion of creativity! Watching a whole globe take 
            shape beneath her feet!" Her green eyes look up into Davout&#8217;s. "We 
            were jealous of you then. All that abundance being created, all that 
            talent going to shaping an entire world. And we were confined to 
            scholarship, which seemed so lifeless by comparison."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He looked at her. &lt;Query&gt; 
            "Are you sorry for the choice you made? You two were senior: you 
            could have chosen our path if you&#8217;d wished. You still could, come to 
            that."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>A smile drifts across her face. 
            "You tempt me, truly. But Old Davout and I are happy in our work&#8211;and 
            besides, you and Katrin needed someone to provide a proper record of 
            your adventures." She tilted her head, and mischief glittered in her 
            eyes. "Perhaps you should ask Blonde Katrin. Maybe she could use a 
            change."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout gave a guilty start: she 
            was, he thought, seeing too near, too soon. "Do you think so?" he 
            asked. "I didn&#8217;t even know if I should see her."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Her grudge is with the Silent 
            One, not with you."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Well." He managed a smile. 
            "Perhaps I will at least call." </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout called Katrin the Fair, 
            received an offer of dinner on the following day, accepted. From his 
            room, he followed the smell of coffee into his hosts&#8217; office, and 
            felt a bubble of grief lodge in his heart: two desks, back-to-back, 
            two computer terminals, layers of papers and books and printout and 
            dust . . . he could imagine himself and Katrin here, sipping coffee, 
            working in pleasant compatibility.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;How goes it?&gt; he 
            signed.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>His sib looked up. "I just sent 
            a chapter to Sheol," he said. "I was making <I>Maxwell</I> far too 
            wise." He fingered his little goatee. "The temptation is always to 
            view the past solely as a vehicle that leads to our present 
            grandeur. These people&#8217;s sole function was to produce <I>us,</I> who 
            are of course perfectly wise and noble and far superior to our 
            ancestors. So one assumes that these people had <I>us</I> in mind 
            all along, that we were what they were working toward. I have to 
            keep reminding myself that these people lived amid unimaginable 
            tragedy, disease and ignorance and superstition, vile little wars, 
            terrible poverty, and <I>death</I> . . ."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He stopped, suddenly aware that 
            he&#8217;d said something awkward&#8211;Davout felt the word vibrate in his 
            bones, as if he were stranded inside a bell that was still singing 
            after it had been struck&#8211;but he said, "Go on."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I remind myself," his sib 
            continued, "that the fact that we live in a modern culture doesn&#8217;t 
            make us better, it doesn&#8217;t make us superior to these people&#8211;in fact 
            it enlarges <I>them,</I> because they had to overcome so much more 
            than we in order to realize themselves, in order to accomplish as 
            much as they did." A shy smile drifted across his face. "And so a 
            rather smug chapter is wiped out of digital existence."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"<I>Lavoisier</I> is looming," 
            commented Red Katrin from her machine.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Yes, that too," Old Davout 
            agreed. His <I>Lavoisier and his</I> <I>Age</I> had won the 
            McEldowney Prize and been shortlisted for other awards. Davout could 
            well imagine that bringing <I>Maxwell</I> up to <I>Lavoisier</I>&#8217;s 
            magisterial standards would be intimidating. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Red Katrin leaned back in her 
            chair, combed her hair back with her fingers. "I made a few notes 
            about the <I>Beagle</I> project," she said. "I have other 
            commitments to deal with first, of course."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She and Old Davout had avoided 
            any conflicts of interest and interpretation by conveniently 
            dividing history between them: she would write of the "modern" world 
            and her near-contemporaries, while he wrote of those securely in the 
            past. Davout thought his sib had the advantage in this arrangement, 
            because her subjects, as time progressed, gradually entered his 
            domain, and became liable to his reinterpretation.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout cleared away some 
            printout, sat on the edge of Red Katrin&#8217;s desk. "A thought keeps 
            bothering me," he said. "In our civilization we record everything. 
            But the last moments of the crew of the <I>Beagle</I> went 
            unrecorded. Does that mean they do not exist? Never existed at all? 
            That death was <I>always</I> their state, and they returned to it, 
            like virtual matter dying into the vacuum from which it 
            came?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Concern darkened Red Katrin&#8217;s 
            eyes. "They will be remembered," she said. "I will see to 
            it."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Katrin didn&#8217;t download the 
            last months, did she?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;No&gt; "The last eight 
            months were never sent. She was very busy, and&#8211;"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Virtual months, then. Gone 
            back to the phantom zone."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"There are records. Other crew 
            sent downloads home, and I will see if I can gain access either to 
            the downloads, or to their friends and relations who have 
            experienced them. There is <I>your</I> memory, your 
            downloads."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He looked at her. "Will you 
            upload my memory, then? My sib has everything in his files, I&#8217;m 
            sure." Glancing at Old Davout.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She pressed her lips together. 
            "That would be difficult for me. <I>Me</I> viewing <I>you</I> 
            viewing <I>her.</I> . . ." She shook her head. "I don&#8217;t dare. Not 
            now. Not when we&#8217;re all still in shock."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Disappointment gnawed at his 
            insides with sharp rodent teeth. He did not want to be so alone in 
            his grief; he didn&#8217;t want to nourish all the sadness by himself. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He wanted to share it with 
            <I>Katrin,</I> he knew, the person with whom he shared everything. 
            Katrin could help him make sense of it, the way she clarified all 
            the world for him. Katrin would comprehend the way he 
            felt.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;I understand&gt; he signed. 
            His frustration must have been plain to Red Katrin, because she took 
            his hand, lifted her green eyes to his.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I will," she said. "But not 
            now. I&#8217;m not ready."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I don&#8217;t want <I>two</I> wrecks 
            in the house," called Old Davout over his shoulder.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Interfering old bastard, Davout 
            thought. But with his free hand he signed, again, &lt;I 
            understand&gt;.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Katrin the Fair kissed Davout&#8217;s 
            cheek, then stood back, holding his hands, and narrowed her grey 
            eyes. "I&#8217;m not sure I approve of this youthful body of yours," she 
            said. "You haven&#8217;t looked like this in&#8211;what&#8211;over a 
            century?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Perhaps I seek to evoke 
            happier times," Davout said.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>A little frown touched the 
            corners of her mouth. "<I>That</I> is always dangerous," she judged. 
            "But I wish you every success." She stepped back from the door, 
            flung out an arm. "Please come in."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She lived in a small apartment 
            in Toulouse, with a view of the Allée Saint-Michel and the rose-red 
            brick of the Vieux Quartier. On the whitewashed walls hung 
            terra-cotta icons of Usil and Tiv, the Etruscan gods of the sun and 
            moon, and a well cover with a figure of the demon Charun emerging 
            from the underworld. The Etruscan deities were confronted, on 
            another wall, by a bronze figure of the Gaulish Rosmerta, consort of 
            the absent Mercurius.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Her little balcony was bedecked 
            with wrought iron and a gay striped awning. In front of the balcony 
            a table shimmered under a red-and-white checked tablecloth: crystal, 
            porcelain, a wicker basket of bread, a bottle of wine. Cooking 
            scents floated in from the kitchen. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"It smells wonderful," Davout 
            said.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Drink?&gt; Lifting the 
            bottle.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Why not?&gt;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Wine was poured. They settled 
            onto the sofa, chatted of weather, crowds, Java. Davout&#8217;s memories 
            of the trip that Silent Davout and his Katrin had taken to the 
            island were more recent than hers. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Fair Katrin took his hand. "I 
            have uploaded Dark Katrin&#8217;s memories, so far as I have them," she 
            said. "She loved you, you know&#8211;absolutely, deeply." &lt;Truth.&gt; 
            She bit her lip. "It was a remarkable thing."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Truth&gt; Davout answered. 
            He touched cool crystal to his lips, took a careful sip of his 
            cabernet. Pain throbbed in the hollows of his heart.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Yes," he said. "I 
            know."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I felt I should tell you about 
            her feelings. Particularly in view of what happened with me and the 
            Silent One."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He looked at her. "I confess I 
            do not understand that business."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She made a little frown of 
            distaste. "We and our work and our situation grew irksome. 
            Oppressive. You may upload his memories if you like&#8211;I daresay you 
            will be able to observe the signs that he was determined to 
            ignore."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;I am sorry.&gt;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Clouds gathered in her grey 
            eyes. "I, too, have regrets."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"There is no chance of 
            reconciliation?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Absolutely not&gt;, 
            accompanied by a brief shake of the head. "It was over." 
            &lt;Finished&gt; "And, in any case, Davout the Silent is not the man 
            he was."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Yes?&gt;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"He took Lethe. It was the only 
            way he had of getting over my leaving him."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Pure amazement throbbed in 
            Davout&#8217;s soul. Fair Katrin looked at him in surprise. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"You didn&#8217;t know?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He blinked at her. "I 
            <I>should</I> have. But I thought he was talking about <I>me,</I> 
            about a way of getting over . . ." Aching sadness brimmed in his 
            throat. "Over the way my Dark Katrin left me."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Scorn whitened the flesh about 
            Fair Katrin&#8217;s nostrils. "That&#8217;s the Silent One for you. He didn&#8217;t 
            have the nerve to tell you outright."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s true. He 
            may have thought he was speaking plainly enough&#8211;"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Her fingers formed a mudra that 
            gave vent to a brand of disdain that did not translate into words. 
            "He knows his effects perfectly well," she said. "He was trying to 
            suggest the idea without making it clear that this was his 
            <I>choice</I> for you, that he wanted you to fall in line with his 
            theories."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Anger was clear in her voice. 
            She rose, stalked angrily to the bronze of Rosmerta, adjusted its 
            place on the wall by a millimeter or so. Turned, waved an arm. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Apologies&gt;, flung to the 
            air. "Let&#8217;s eat. Silent Davout is the last person I want to talk 
            about right now."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I&#8217;m sorry I upset you." Davout 
            was not sorry at all: he found this display fascinating. The 
            gestures, the tone of voice, were utterly familiar, ringing like 
            chimes in his heart; but the <I>style,</I> the way Fair Katrin 
            avoided the issue, was different. Dark Katrin never would have fled 
            a subject this way: she would have knit her brows and confronted the 
            problem direct, engaged with it until she&#8217;d either reached 
            understanding or catastrophe. Either way, she&#8217;d have laughed, and 
            tossed her dark hair, and announced that now she 
            understood.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"It&#8217;s peasant cooking," Katrin 
            the Fair said as she bustled to the kitchen, "which of course is the 
            best kind." </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>The main course was a ragoût of 
            veal in a velouté sauce, beans cooked simply in butter and garlic, 
            tossed salad, bread. Davout waited until it was half consumed, and 
            the bottle of wine mostly gone, before he dared to speak again of 
            his sib.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"You mentioned the Silent One 
            and his theories," he said. "I&#8217;m thirty years behind on his 
            downloads, and I haven&#8217;t read his latest work&#8211;what is he up to? 
            What&#8217;s all this theorizing about?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She sighed, fingers ringing a 
            frustrated rhythm on her glass. Looked out the window for a moment, 
            then conceded. "Has he mentioned the modular theory of the 
            psyche?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout tried to remember. "He 
            said something about modular <I>memory,</I> I seem to 
            recall."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Yes&gt; "That&#8217;s a part of 
            it. It&#8217;s a fairly radical theory that states that people should edit 
            their personality and abilities at will, as circumstances dictate. 
            That one morning, say, if you&#8217;re going to work, you upload 
            appropriate memories, and work skills, along with a dose of 
            ambition, of resolution, and some appropriate emotions like 
            satisfaction and eagerness to solve problems, or endure drudgery, as 
            the case may be."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout looked at his plate. 
            "Like cookery, then," he said. "Like this dish&#8211;veal, carrots, 
            onions, celery, mushrooms, parsley."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Fair Katrin made a mudra that 
            Davout didn&#8217;t recognize. &lt;Sorry?&gt; he signed.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Oh. Apologies. That one means, 
            roughly, &#8216;har-de-har-har.&#8217; " Fingers formed &lt;laughter&gt;, then 
            &lt;sarcasm&gt;, then slurred them together. "See?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Understood.&gt; He poured 
            more wine into her glass.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She leaned forward across her 
            plate. "Recipes are fine if one wants to be <I>consumed,</I>" she 
            said. "Survival is another matter. The human mind is more than just 
            ingredients to be tossed together. The atomistic view of the psyche 
            is simplistic, dangerous, and <I>wrong</I>. You cannot <I>will</I> a 
            psyche to be whole, no matter how many <I>wholeness</I> modules are 
            uploaded. A psyche is more than the sum of its parts."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Wine and agitation burnished 
            her cheeks. Conviction blazed from her eyes. "It takes <I>time</I> 
            to integrate new experience, new abilities. The modular theorists 
            claim this will be done by a &#8216;conductor,&#8217; an artificial intelligence 
            that will be able to judge between alternate personalities and 
            abilities and upload whatever&#8217;s needed. But that&#8217;s such 
            <I>rubbish,</I> I&#8211;" She looked at the knife she was waving, then 
            permitted it to return to the table. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"How far are the Silent One and 
            his cohorts toward realizing this ambition?" Davout said.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Beg pardon?&gt; She looked 
            at him. "I didn&#8217;t make that clear?" she said. "The technology is 
            already here. It&#8217;s happening. People are fragmenting their psyches 
            deliberately and trusting to their conductors to make sense of it 
            all. And they&#8217;re <I>happy</I> with their choices, because that&#8217;s the 
            only emotion they permit themselves to upload from their supply." 
            She clenched her teeth, glanced angrily out the window at the Vieux 
            Quartier&#8217;s sunset-burnished walls. "All traditional psychology is 
            aimed at integration, at wholeness. And now it&#8217;s all to be <I>thrown 
            away.</I> . . ." She flung her hand out the window. Davout&#8217;s eyes 
            automatically followed an invisible object on its arc from her 
            fingers toward the street.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"And how does this theory work 
            in practice?" Davout asked. "Are the streets filled with 
            psychological wrecks?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Bitterness twisted her lips. 
            "Psychological imbeciles, more like. Executing their conductors&#8217; 
            orders, docile as well-fed children, happy as clams. They upload 
            passions&#8211;anger, grief, loss&#8211;as artificial experiences, secondhand 
            from someone else, usually so they can tell their conductor to avoid 
            such emotions in the future. They are not <I>people</I> any more, 
            they&#8217;re . . ." Her eyes turned to Davout.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"You saw the Silent One," she 
            said. "Would you call him a <I>person?</I>"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I was with him for only a 
            day," Davout said. "I noticed something of a . . ." &lt;Stand by&gt; 
            he signed, searching for the word.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Lack of affect?" she 
            interposed. "A demeanor marked by an extreme placidity?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Truth&gt; he 
            signed.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"When it was clear I wouldn&#8217;t 
            come back to him, he wrote me out of his memory," Fair Katrin said. 
            "He replaced the memories with <I>facts</I>&#8211;he knows he was married 
            to me, he knows we went to such-and-such a place or wrote 
            such-and-such a paper&#8211;but there&#8217;s nothing else there. No feelings, 
            no real memories good or bad, no understanding, nothing left from 
            almost two centuries together." Tears glittered in her eyes. "I&#8217;d 
            rather he felt anything at all&#8211;I&#8217;d rather he hated me than feel this 
            apathy!"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout reached across the 
            little table and took her hand. "It is his decision," he said, "and 
            his loss."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"It is <I>all</I> our loss," 
            she said. Reflected sunset flavored her tears with the color of 
            roses. "The man we loved is gone. And millions are gone with 
            him&#8211;millions of little half-alive souls, programmed for happiness 
            and unconcern." She tipped the bottle into her glass, received only 
            a sluicing of dregs.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Let&#8217;s have another," she 
            said.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>When he left, some hours later, 
            he embraced her, kissed her, let his lips linger on hers for perhaps 
            an extra half-second. She blinked up at him in wine-muddled 
            surprise, and then he took his leave.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"How did you find my sib?" Red 
            Katrin asked.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Unhappy," Davout said. 
            "Confused. Lonely, I think. Living in a little apartment like a 
            cell, with icons and memories."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;I know&gt; she signed, and 
            turned on him a knowing green-eyed look. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Are you planning on taking her 
            away from all that? To the stars, perhaps?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout&#8217;s surprise was brief. He 
            looked away and murmured, "I didn&#8217;t know I was so 
            transparent.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>A smile touched her lips. 
            &lt;Apologies&gt; she signed. "I&#8217;ve lived with Old Davout for nearly 
            two hundred years. You and he haven&#8217;t grown so very far apart in 
            that time. My fair sib deserves happiness, and so do you . . . if 
            you can provide it, so much the better. But I wonder if you are not 
            moving too fast, if you have thought it all out." </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Moving fast, Davout wondered. 
            His life seemed so very slow now, a creeping dance with agony, each 
            move a lifetime. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He glanced out at Chesapeake 
            Bay, saw his second perfect sunset in only a few hours&#8211;the same 
            sunset he&#8217;d watched from Fair Katrin&#8217;s apartment, now radiating its 
            red glories on the other side of the Atlantic. A few water-skaters 
            sped toward home on their silver blades. He sat with Red Katrin on a 
            porch swing, looking down the long green sward to the bayfront, the 
            old wooden pier, and the sparkling water, that profound, deep blue 
            that sang of home to Davout&#8217;s soul. Red Katrin wrapped herself 
            against the breeze in a fringed, autumn-colored shawl. Davout sipped 
            coffee from gold-rimmed porcelain, set the cup into its saucer. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I wondered if I was being 
            untrue to <I>my</I> Katrin," he said. "But they are really the same 
            person, aren&#8217;t they? If I were to pursue some other woman now, I 
            would know I was committing a betrayal. But how can I betray Katrin 
            with herself?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>An uncertain look crossed Red 
            Katrin&#8217;s face. "I&#8217;ve downloaded them both," she said hesitantly, 
            "and I&#8217;m not certain that the Dark and Fair Katrins are quite the 
            same person. Or ever were."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Not the same&#8211;of course he knew 
            that. Fair Katrin was not a perfect copy of her older sib&#8211;she had 
            flaws, clear enough. She had been damaged, somehow. But the flaws 
            could be worked on, the damage repaired. Conquered. There was 
            infinite time. He would see it done.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Question&gt; "And how do 
            your sibs differ, then?" he asked. "Other than obvious differences 
            in condition and profession?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She drew her legs up and rested 
            her chin on her knees. Her green eyes were pensive. "Matters of 
            love," she said, "and happiness."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>And further she would not 
            say.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout took Fair Katrin to 
            Tangier for the afternoon and walked with her up on the old palace 
            walls. Below them, white in the sun, the curved mole built by 
            Charles II cleaved the Middle Sea, a thin crescent moon laid upon 
            the perfect shimmering azure. (Home! home!, the waters cried.) The 
            sea breeze lashed her blonde hair across her face, snapped little 
            sonic booms from the sleeves of his shirt.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I have sampled some of the 
            Silent One&#8217;s downloads," Davout said. "I wished to discover the 
            nature of this artificial tranquility with which he has endowed 
            himself."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Fair Katrin&#8217;s lips twisted in 
            distaste, and her fingers formed a scatologue.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"It was . . . interesting," 
            Davout said. "There was a strange, uncomplicated quality of bliss to 
            it. I remember experiencing the download of a master sitting zazen 
            once, and it was an experience of a similar cast."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"It may have been the exact 
            same sensation." Sourly. "He may have just copied the Zen master&#8217;s 
            experience and slotted it into his brain. That&#8217;s how <I>most</I> of 
            the vampires do it&#8211;award themselves the joy they haven&#8217;t 
            earned."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"That&#8217;s a Calvinistic point of 
            view," Davout offered. "That happiness can&#8217;t just happen, that it 
            has to be earned." </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She frowned out at the sea. 
            "There is a difference between real experience and artificial or 
            recapitulative experience. If that&#8217;s Calvinist, so be 
it."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Yes&gt; Davout signed. 
            "Call me a Calvinist sympathizer, then. I have been enough places, 
            done enough things, so that it matters to me that I was actually 
            there and not living out some programmed dream of life on other 
            worlds. I&#8217;ve experienced my sibs&#8217; downloads&#8211;lived significant parts 
            of their lives, moment by moment&#8211;but it is not the same as <I>my 
            life,</I> as <I>being me.</I> I am," he said, leaning elbows on the 
            palace wall, "I am myself, I am the sum of everything that happened 
            to me, I stand on this wall, I am watching this sea, I am watching 
            it with you, and no one else has had this experience, nor ever 
            shall, it is <I>ours,</I> it belongs to <I>us .</I> . ."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She looked up at him, 
            straw-hair flying over an unreadable expression. "Davout the 
            Conqueror," she said.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;No&gt; he signed. "I did 
            not conquer alone."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She nodded, holding his eyes 
            for a long moment. "Yes," she said. "I know."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He took Katrin the Fair in his 
            arms and kissed her. There was a moment&#8217;s stiff surprise, and then 
            she began to laugh, helpless peals bursting against his lips. He 
            held her for a moment, too surprised to react, and then she broke 
            free. She reeled along the wall, leaning for support against the old 
            stones. Davout followed, babbling, "I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean 
            to&#8211;"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She leaned back against the 
            wall. Words burst half-hysterical from her lips, in between bursts 
            of desperate, unamused laughter. "So <I>that&#8217;s</I> what you were 
            after! My God! As if I hadn&#8217;t had enough of you all after all these 
            years!"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I apologize," Davout said. 
            "Let&#8217;s forget this happened. I&#8217;ll take you home."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She looked up at him, the 
            laughter gone, blazing anger in its place. "The Silent One and I 
            would have been all right if it hadn&#8217;t been for you&#8211;<I>for our 
            sibs!</I>" She flung her words like daggers, her voice breaking with 
            passion. "You lot were the eldest, you&#8217;d already parceled out the 
            world between you. You were only interested in psychology because my 
            damned Red sib and your Old one wanted insight into the characters 
            in their histories, and because you and your dark bitch wanted a 
            theory of the psyche to aid you in building communities on other 
            worlds. We only got created because <I>you were too damned lazy to 
            do your</I> <I>own research!</I>"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout stood, stunned. 
            &lt;No&gt; he signed, "That&#8217;s not&#8211;"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"We were <I>third,</I>" she 
            cried. "We were <I>born in third place.</I> We got the jobs you 
            wanted <I>least,</I> and while you older sibs were winning fame and 
            glory, we were stuck in work that didn&#8217;t suit, that you&#8217;d <I>cast 
            off,</I> awarded to us as if we were charity cases&#8211;" She stepped 
            closer, and Davout was amazed to find a white-knuckled fist being 
            shaken in his face. "My husband was called The Silent because his 
            sibs had already used up all the words! He was third-rate and 
            <I>knew</I> it! It <I>destroyed</I> him! Now he&#8217;s plugging 
            artificial satisfaction into his head because it&#8217;s the only way 
            he&#8217;ll ever feel it."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"If you didn&#8217;t like your life," 
            Davout said, "you could have changed it. People start over all the 
            time&#8211;we&#8217;d have helped." He reached toward her. "I can help you to 
            the stars, if that&#8217;s what you want."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She backed away. "The only help 
            we ever needed was to <I>get</I> <I>rid of you!</I>" A mudra, 
            &lt;har-de-har-har&gt;, echoed the sarcastic laughter on Fair 
            Katrin&#8217;s lips. "And now there&#8217;s another gap in your life, and you 
            want me to fill it&#8211;<I>not this time</I>."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;<I>Never</I>&gt; her 
            fingers echoed. &lt;<I>Never.</I>&gt; The laughter bubbled from her 
            throat again.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She fled, leaving him alone and 
            dazed on the palace wall, as the booming wind mocked his feeble 
            protests.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I am truly sorry," Red Katrin 
            said. She leaned close to him on the porch swing, touched soft lips 
            to his cheek. "Even though she edited her downloads, I could tell 
            she resented us&#8211;but I truly did not know how she would 
            react."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout was frantic. He could 
            feel Katrin slipping farther and farther away, as if she were on the 
            edge of a precipice and her handholds were crumbling away beneath 
            her clawed fingers. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Is what she said true?" he 
            asked. "Have we been slighting them all these years? Using them, as 
            she claims?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Perhaps she had some 
            justification once," Red Katrin said. "I do not remember anything of 
            the sort when we were young, when I was uploading Fair Katrin almost 
            every day. But now . . ." Her expression grew severe. "These are 
            mature people, not without resources or intelligence&#8211;I can&#8217;t help 
            but think that surely after a person is a century old, any problems 
            that remain are <I>her</I> fault."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>As he rocked on the porch swing 
            he could feel a wildness rising in him. <I>My God,</I> he thought, 
            <I>I am going to be</I> alone. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>His brief days of hope were 
            gone. He stared out at the bay&#8211;the choppy water was too rough for 
            any but the most dedicated water-skaters&#8211;and felt the pain pressing 
            on his brain, like the two thumbs of a practiced sadist digging into 
            the back of his skull. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I wonder," he said. "Have you 
            given any further thought to uploading my memories?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She looked at him curiously. 
            "It&#8217;s scarcely time yet."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I feel a need to share . . . 
            some things."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Old Davout has uploaded them. 
            You could speak to him."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>This perfectly intelligent 
            suggestion only made him clench his teeth. He needed <I>sense</I> 
            made of things, he needed things put in <I>order,</I> and that was 
            not the job of his sib. Old Davout would only confirm what he 
            already knew.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I&#8217;ll talk to him, then," he 
            said.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>And then never did.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>The pain was worst at night. It 
            wasn&#8217;t the sleeping alone, or merely Katrin&#8217;s absence: it was the 
            knowledge that she would <I>always</I> be absent, that the empty 
            space next to him would be there forever. It was then that the 
            horror fully struck him, and he would lie awake for hours, eyes 
            staring into the terrible void that wrapped him in its dark cloak, 
            while fits of trembling sped through his limbs.</FONT></P>
            <P><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>I will go 
            mad,</FONT></I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2> he sometimes 
            thought. It seemed something he could choose, as if he were a 
            character in an Elizabethan drama who turns to the audience to 
            announce that he will be mad now, and then in the next scene is 
            found gnawing bones dug out of the family sepulcher. Davout could 
            see himself being found outside, running on all fours and barking at 
            the stars. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>And then, as dawn crept across 
            the windowsill, he would look out the window and realize, to his 
            sorrow, that he was not yet mad, that he was condemned to another 
            day of sanity, of pain, and of grief.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Then, one night, he <I>did</I> 
            go mad. He found himself squatting on the floor in his nightshirt, 
            the room a ruin around him: mirrors smashed, furniture broken. Blood 
            was running down his forearms. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>The door leapt off its hinges 
            with a heave of Old Davout&#8217;s shoulder. Davout realized, in a vague 
            way, that his sib had been trying to get in for some time. He saw 
            Red Katrin&#8217;s silhouette in the door, an aureate halo around her 
            auburn hair in the instant before Old Davout snapped on the 
            light.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Afterward Katrin pulled the 
            bits of broken mirror out of Davout&#8217;s hands, washed and disinfected 
            them, while his sib tried to reconstruct the green room and its 
            antique furniture. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout watched his spatters of 
            blood stain the water, threads of scarlet whirling in coreolis 
            spirals. "I&#8217;m sorry," he said. "I think I may be losing my 
            mind."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I doubt that." Frowning at a 
            bit of glass in her tweezers.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I want to <I>know</I>." 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Something in his voice made her 
            look up. "Yes?"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He could see his staring 
            reflection in her green eyes. "Read my downloads. Please. I want to 
            know if . . . I&#8217;m reacting normally in all this. If I&#8217;m lucid or 
            just . . ." He fell silent. <I>Do it,</I> he thought. <I>Just do 
            this one thing.</I></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I don&#8217;t upload other people. 
            Davout can do that. <I>Old</I> Davout, I mean."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>No, Davout thought. His sib 
            would understand all too well what he was up to.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"But he&#8217;s me!" he said. "He&#8217;d 
            think I&#8217;m normal!"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Silent Davout, then. Crazy 
            people are his specialty."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout wanted to make a mudra 
            of scorn, but Red Katrin held his hands captive. Instead he gave a 
            laugh. "He&#8217;d want me to take Lethe. Any advice he gave would be . . 
            . in that direction." He made a fist of one hand, saw drops of blood 
            well up through the cuts. "I need to know if I can stand this," he 
            said. "If&#8211;something drastic is required."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She nodded, looked again at the 
            sharp little spear of glass, put it deliberately on the edge of the 
            porcelain. Her eyes narrowed in thought&#8211;Davout felt his heart vault 
            at that look, at the familiar lines forming at the corner of Red 
            Katrin&#8217;s right eye, each one known and adored. </FONT></P>
            <P><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Please do 
            it,</FONT></I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2> he thought 
            desperately.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"If it&#8217;s that important to 
            you," she said, "I will."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Thank you," he said. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He bent his head over her and 
            the basin, raised her hand, and pressed his lips to the flesh beaded 
            with water and streaked with blood.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>It was almost like conducting 
            an affair, all clandestine meetings and whispered arrangements. Red 
            Katrin did not want Old Davout to know she was uploading his sib&#8217;s 
            memories&#8211;"I would just as soon not deal with his disapproval"&#8211;and so 
            she and Davout had to wait until he was gone for a few hours, a trip 
            to record a lecture for Cavor&#8217;s series on <I>Ideas and 
            Manners.</I></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She settled onto the settee in 
            the front room and covered herself with her fringed shawl. Closed 
            her eyes. Let Davout&#8217;s memories roll through her.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He sat in a chair nearby, his 
            mouth dry. Though nearly thirty years had passed since Dark Katrin&#8217;s 
            death, he had experienced only a few weeks of that time; and Red 
            Katrin was floating through these memories at speed, tasting here 
            and there, skipping redundancies or moments that seemed 
            inconsequential . . .</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He tried to guess from her face 
            where in his life she dwelt. The expression of shock and horror near 
            the start was clear enough, the shuttle bursting into flames. After 
            the shock faded, he recognized the discomfort that came with 
            experiencing a strange mind, and flickering across her face came 
            expressions of grief, anger, and here and there amusement; but 
            gradually there was only a growing sadness, and lashes wet with 
            tears. He crossed the room to kneel by her chair and take her hand. 
            Her fingers pressed his in response . . . she took a breath, rolled 
            her head away . . . he wanted to weep not for his grief, but for 
            hers.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>The eyes fluttered open. She 
            shook her head. "I had to stop," she said. "I couldn&#8217;t take it&#8211;" She 
            looked at him, a kind of awe in her wide green eyes. "My God, the 
            sadness! And the <I>need.</I> I had no idea. I&#8217;ve never felt such 
            need. I wonder what it is to be needed that way."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He kissed her hand, her damp 
            cheek. Her arms went around him. He felt a leap of joy, of clarity. 
            The need was hers, now.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout carried her to the bed 
            she shared with his sib, and together they worshipped memories of 
            his Katrin.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I will take you there," Davout 
            said. His finger reached into the night sky, counted stars, <I>one, 
            two, three. . . .</I> "The planet&#8217;s called Atugan. It&#8217;s boiling hot, 
            nothing but rock and desert, sulphur and slag. But we can make it 
            home for ourselves and our children&#8211;all the species of children we 
            desire, fish and fowl." A bubble of happiness filled his heart. 
            "Dinosaurs, if you like," he said. "Would you like to be parent to a 
            dinosaur?" </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He felt Katrin leave the 
            shelter of his arm, step toward the moonlit bay. Waves rumbled under 
            the old wooden pier. "I&#8217;m not trained for terraforming," she said. 
            "I&#8217;d be useless on such a trip."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I&#8217;m decades behind in my own 
            field," Davout said. "You could learn while I caught up. You&#8217;ll have 
            Dark Katrin&#8217;s downloads to help. It&#8217;s all possible."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She turned toward him. The 
            lights of the house glowed yellow off her pale face, off her swift 
            fingers as she signed.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Regret&gt; "I have lived 
            with Old Davout for near two centuries," she said. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>His life, for a moment, seemed 
            to skip off its internal track; he felt himself suspended, poised at 
            the top of an arc just before the fall.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Her eyes brooded up at the 
            house, where Old Davout paced and sipped coffee and pondered his 
            life of Maxwell. The mudras at her fingertips were unreadable in the 
            dark.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I will do as I did before," 
            she said. "I cannot go with you, but my other self will."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout felt his life resume. 
            "Yes," he said, because he was in shadow and could not sign. "By all 
            means." He stepped nearer to her. "I would rather it be you," he 
            whispered.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He saw wry amusement touch the 
            corners of her mouth. "It <I>will</I> be me," she said. She stood on 
            tiptoe, kissed his cheek. "But now I am your sister again, yes?" Her 
            eyes looked level into his. "Be patient. I will arrange 
            it."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I will in all things obey you, 
            madam," he said, and felt wild hope singing in his heart.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout was present at her 
            awakening, and her hand was in his as she opened her violet eyes, 
            the eyes of his Dark Katrin. She looked at him in perfect 
            comprehension, lifted a hand to her black hair; and then the eyes 
            turned to the pair standing behind him, to Old Davout and Red 
            Katrin.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Young man," Davout said, 
            putting his hand on Davout&#8217;s shoulder, "allow me to present you to 
            my wife." And then (wisest of the sibs), he bent over and whispered, 
            a bit pointedly, into Davout&#8217;s ear, "I trust you will do the same 
            for me, one day."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Davout concluded, through his 
            surprise, that the secret of a marriage that lasts two hundred years 
            is knowing when to turn a blind eye.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I confess I am somewhat 
            envious," Red Katrin said as she and Old Davout took their leave. "I 
            envy my twin her new life."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"It&#8217;s your life as well," he 
            said. "She <I>is</I> you." But she looked at him soberly, and her 
            fingers formed a mudra he could not read.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He took her on honeymoon to the 
            Rockies, used some of his seventy-eight years&#8217; back pay to rent a 
            sprawling cabin in a high valley above the headwaters of the Rio 
            Grande, where the wind rolled grandly through the pines, hawks spun 
            lazy high circles on the afternoon thermals, and the brilliant clear 
            light blazed on white starflowers and Indian paintbrush. They went 
            on long walks in the high hills, cooked simply in the cramped 
            kitchen, slept beneath scratchy trade blankets, made love on crisp 
            cotton sheets.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He arranged an office there, 
            two desks and two chairs, back-to-back. Katrin applied herself to 
            learning biology, ecology, nanotech, and quantum physics&#8211;she already 
            had a good grounding, but a specialist&#8217;s knowledge was lacking. 
            Davout tutored her, and worked hard at catching up with the latest 
            developments in the field. She&#8211;they did not have a name for her yet, 
            though Davout thought of her as "New Katrin"&#8211;would review Dark 
            Katrin&#8217;s old downloads, concentrating on her work, the way she 
            visualized a problem.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Once, opening her eyes after an 
            upload, she looked at Davout and shook her head. "It&#8217;s strange," she 
            said. "It&#8217;s <I>me,</I> I know it&#8217;s me, but the way she 
            <I>thinks</I>&#8211;" &lt;I don&#8217;t understand&gt; she signed. "It&#8217;s not 
            memories that make us, we&#8217;re told, but patterns of thought. We are 
            who we are because we think using certain patterns . . . but I do 
            not seem to think like her at all."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"It&#8217;s habit," Davout said. 
            "Your habit is to think a different way."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Possibly&gt; she conceded, 
            brows knit. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Truth&gt; "You&#8211;Red 
            Katrin&#8211;uploaded Dark Katrin before. You had no difficulty in 
            understanding her then."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I did not concentrate on the 
            technical aspects of her work, on the way she visualized and solved 
            problems. They were beyond my skill to interpret&#8211;I paid more 
            attention to other moments in her life." She lifted her eyes to 
            Davout. "Her moments with you, for instance. Which were very rich, 
            and very intense, and which sometimes made me jealous."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"No need for jealousy 
            now."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Perhaps&gt; she signed, but 
            her dark eyes were thoughtful, and she turned away.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He felt Katrin&#8217;s silence after 
            that, an absence that seemed to fill the cabin with the invisible, 
            weighty cloud of her somber thought. Katrin spent her time studying 
            by herself or restlessly paging through Dark Katrin&#8217;s downloads. At 
            meals and in bed, she was quiet, meditative&#8211;perfectly friendly, and, 
            he thought, not unhappy&#8211;but keeping her thoughts to 
            herself.</FONT></P>
            <P><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She is 
            adjusting,</FONT></I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2> he thought. 
            <I>It is not an easy thing for someone two centuries old to change. 
            </I></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"I have realized," she said ten 
            days later at breakfast, "that my sib&#8211;that Red Katrin&#8211;is a coward. 
            That I am created&#8211;and the other sibs, too&#8211;to do what she would not, 
            or dared not." Her violet eyes gazed levelly at Davout. "She wanted 
            to go with you to Atugan, she wanted to feel the power of your 
            desire . . . but something held her back. So I am created to do the 
            job for her. It is my purpose . . . to fulfill <I>her</I> 
            purpose."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"It&#8217;s her loss, then," Davout 
            said, though his fingers signed &lt;surprise&gt;.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;Alas!&gt; she signed, and 
            Davout felt a shiver caress his spine. "But I am a coward, too!" 
            Katrin cried. "I am <I>not</I> your brave Dark Katrin, and I cannot 
            become her!"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Katrin," he said. "You are the 
            same person&#8211;you <I>all</I> are!"</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>She shook her head. "I do not 
            think like your Katrin. I do not have her courage. I do not know 
            what liberated her from her fear, but it is something I do not have. 
            And&#8211;" She reached across the table to clasp his hand. "I do not have 
            the feelings for you that she possessed. I simply do not. I have 
            tried, I have had that world-eating passion read into my mind, and I 
            compare it with what I feel, and&#8211;what I have is as nothing. I 
            <I>wish</I> I felt as she did, I truly do. But if I love anyone, it 
            is Old Davout. And . . ." She let go his hand, and rose from the 
            table. "I am a coward, and I will take the coward&#8217;s way out. I must 
            leave."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>&lt;No&gt; his fingers formed, 
            then &lt;please&gt;. "You can change that," he said. He followed her 
            into the bedroom. "It&#8217;s just a switch in your mind, Silent Davout 
            can throw it for you, we can love each other forever. . . ." She 
            made no answer. As she began to pack, grief seized him by the throat 
            and the words dried up. He retreated to the little kitchen, sat at 
            the table, held his head in his hands. He looked up when she paused 
            in the door, and froze like a deer in the violet light of her 
            eyes.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Fair Katrin was right," she 
            said. "Our elder sibs are bastards&#8211;they use us, and not 
            kindly."</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>A few moments later he heard a 
            car drive up, then leave. &lt;Alas!&gt; his fingers signed. 
            &lt;Alas!&gt;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He spent the day unable to 
            leave the cabin, unable to work, terror shivering through him. After 
            dark, he was driven outside by the realization that he would have to 
            sleep on sheets that were touched with Katrin&#8217;s scent. He wandered 
            by starlight across the high mountain meadow, dry soil crunching 
            beneath his boots, and when his legs began to ache he sat down 
            heavily in the dust.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"<I>I am weary of my 
            groaning.</I> . . ." he thought.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>It was summer, but the high 
            mountains were chill at night, and the deep cold soaked his 
            thoughts. The word <I>Lethe</I> floated through his mind. Who would 
            not choose to be happy? he asked himself. It is a switch in your 
            mind, and someone can throw it for you. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He felt the slow, aching 
            droplets of mourning being squeezed from his heart, one after the 
            other, and wondered how long he could endure them, the relentless 
            moments, each striking with the impact of a hammer, each a stunning, 
            percussive blow. . . .</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>Throw a switch, he thought, and 
            the hammerblows would end. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>"Katrin deserves mourning," he 
            had told Davout the Silent, and now he had so many more Katrins to 
            mourn, Dark Katrin and Katrin the Fair, Katrin the New and Katrin 
            the Old. All the Katrins webbed by fate, alive or dead or merely 
            enduring. And so he would, from necessity, endure. . . . <I>So long 
            lives this, and this gives life to thee.</I> </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica size=2>He lay on his back, on the cold 
            ground, gazed up at the world of stars, and tried to find the 
            worlds, among the glittering teardrops of the heavens, where he and 
            Katrin had rained from the sky their millions of 
          children.</FONT></P></TD>
